### Summary
Intelligence refers to the ability to use the mind in the face of events in daily life, to adapt, and to implement it in the light of knowledge and experience.
From the simplest to the most complex events, there is instant intelligence in every aspect of life. Intelligence is first and foremost about the use of reason and intelligence. The simplest and most basic; are reasoning, planning, abstract thinking, comprehension, learning, and learning from experience. All of this is an intelligence process. But intelligence is not just about them.
### What is Intelligence?<br>
In terms of the meaning of the word intelligence, it was translated into Turkish from Arabic. As the origin of the word, it has gained meaning in Turkish as the plural of the word "Istikhbar", which expresses the present tense in Arabic. In terms of meaning, it means "news", "new news", "new information". Technically speaking, "Intelligence is a product or information produced as a result of processing news (raw information)." Intelligence is to evaluate raw information and reach a conclusion with activities such as reasoning, planning, and data collection. Thus, the information obtained through intelligence activities is also used in intelligence activities. The information thus obtained is of great importance. How important is intelligence in this situation?
<br><br>
### Why Intelligence Matters?<br>
When we fully understand the meaning of intelligence, it is easier to understand why intelligence is important. Because intelligence means information. The importance of intelligence means to be able to see the future, to have prior knowledge of possible problems that may occur, and reach the real causes and sources of events and information, and intelligence is therefore important. News is raw information. In order to produce intelligence data, raw information must be systematically processed. Important intelligence, in other words, news, if not handled correctly, can lead to wrong results and plot. So how is intelligence data processed?<br><br>
### How is Intelligence Data Processed?<br>
There are many methods of processing intelligence data. The raw information gathered about an event that has happened or will happen is processed through stages with interpretation and reasoning. Interpretation, that is, classification is the first stage of processing intelligence data. At this stage, similar information is brought together and interpreted among the raw information. Another topic of processing can be said as valuation, that is, valuation. In this process, it is the evaluation of the previously classified data. At this stage, factors such as the source, reliability, and accuracy of the data are evaluated and comments are made. Interpretation is the process of revealing the meaning and importance of the developments and similar situations based on the available intelligence data in order to reach a definite conclusion. Finally, it is the delivery of the intelligence data passed through these stages to the institutions and organizations that need it, when necessary and with appropriate reporting. And so the intelligence cycle is completed. Most intelligence agencies have given this order different names. There are names such as Intelligence cycle, Intelligence cycle, and Intelligence order. But they are all different nomenclature of the same methodology. Although this cycle often consists of 4 basic steps, it can be divided into different categories and classes as long as more filtering is required. <br>

So, let's get rid of the basics and take a short trip in terms of intelligence. So, what is this intelligence cycle?<br><br>

### What is the Intelligence Cycle?<br>
What is the Intelligence Cycle? As can be seen in the example I added above, the intelligence cycle means the regular and systematic processing of the data obtained through intelligence. This cycle has an endless loop and an operation that constantly renews itself. In addition, intelligence activities are studies that continue uninterrupted. For this reason, many different institutions, basically similar to this methodology, have many different methods of processing intelligence data. However, it is necessary to examine them in 4 main branches:<br>

<b> • Intelligence Needs Assessment: </b> Identification of Intelligence Needs, which is the first phase of intelligence, has an important place in the initiation and continuity of the intelligence cycle. In this part, it is aimed to get more results from the institution that will obtain the intelligence, by giving the main information required by the institution or organization that will provide the intelligence to the institution that will obtain the intelligence. Thus, the cycle begins and the intelligence agency bears the responsibility until the last stage.<br>

<b> • Intelligence Gathering: </b> In the second phase of intelligence, the institution or organization requesting the intelligence is completely removed from the intelligence cycle and all the work is left to the intelligence agency. At this stage of the cycle, the "data collection" part, which is the basic building block of the intelligence process, takes charge. At this stage, while the data collection process continues with the institution's own methods, the data obtained are divided into two open and closed. Since resources such as newspapers, books, magazines, radio, and television are accessible to everyone, they are called Open Sources in this section. In other words, it is a different expression of the Open-Source word that creates OSINT.<br><br>
In addition to open and accessible sources, the data obtained by intelligence agencies by applying different methods and methods during the "data collection" stage are also referred to as closed intelligence data. Well, let's take a look at what needs to be done after collecting the data.<br>

<b> • Processing of Intelligence Data: </b> The third phase of intelligence includes the processing and evaluation of data collected in the previous phase. When collecting intelligence data, we divided it into two parts. This filtering method allowed us to divide the data into two different categories, Open and Closed. The next method for categorizing data is the appraisal and classification part. In this section, the accuracy of the data is first questioned. The data verified by various sources belonging to the institutions are evaluated as to what kind and to what extent it can be used upon incoming demand. To explain in detail. Classification is the first part of this phase. In the evaluation of the data, similar data are brought together thanks to the classification process. Another step is to evaluate the data, in other words, to evaluate it. In the valuation phase, similar data are graded by various methods according to the accuracy and trust of the source. In the last stage, the obtained data is interpreted. As I said at the beginning of my article. Intelligence drives reasoning and achieves results. And so the final phase is passed.

<b> • Using Intelligence Data: </b>In the fourth and final phase of intelligence, there is the use and publication of data that we have evaluated and interpreted in the previous phase. If we take a scenario-based example, after the data obtained as a result of such a cycle is interpreted, based on the necessary analysis and methods, it is transmitted to the institution requesting the intelligence data. Although we seem to have reached the end of such a cycle, we are returning to the first step in the opposite way. That's why the intelligence cycle is endless. It has a structure that constantly renews itself.

Although we have come to the end of this beautiful article for today, I will be with you 2 times a week with my regular blog posts. Thank you for reading my article and I wish you a good day.
