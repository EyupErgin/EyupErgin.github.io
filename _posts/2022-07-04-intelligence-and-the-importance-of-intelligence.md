### Summary
Intelligence refers to the ability to use the mind in the face of events in daily life, to adapt, and to implement it in the light of knowledge and experience.
From the simplest to the most complex events, there is instant intelligence in every aspect of life. Intelligence is first and foremost about the use of reason and intelligence. The simplest and most basic; are reasoning, planning, abstract thinking, comprehension, learning, and learning from experience. All of this is an intelligence process. But intelligence is not just about them.
### What is Intelligence?<br>
In terms of the meaning of the word intelligence, it was translated into Turkish from Arabic. As the origin of the word, it has gained meaning in Turkish as the plural of the word "Istikhbar", which expresses the present tense in Arabic. In terms of meaning, it means "news", "new news", "new information". Technically speaking, "Intelligence is a product or information produced as a result of processing news (raw information)." Intelligence is to evaluate raw information and reach a conclusion with activities such as reasoning, planning, and data collection. Thus, the information obtained through intelligence activities is also used in intelligence activities. The information thus obtained is of great importance. How important is intelligence in this situation?

### Why Intelligence Matters?<br>
When we fully understand the meaning of intelligence, it is easier to understand why intelligence is important. Because intelligence means information. The importance of intelligence means to be able to see the future, to have prior knowledge of possible problems that may occur, and reach the real causes and sources of events and information, and intelligence is therefore important. News is raw information. In order to produce intelligence data, raw information must be systematically processed. Important intelligence, in other words, news, if not handled correctly, can lead to wrong results and plot. So how is intelligence data processed?<br><br>
### How is Intelligence Data Processed?<br>
There are many methods of processing intelligence data. The raw information gathered about an event that has happened or will happen is processed through stages with interpretation and reasoning. Interpretation, that is, classification is the first stage of processing intelligence data. At this stage, similar information is brought together and interpreted among the raw information. Another topic of processing can be said as valuation, that is, valuation. In this process, it is the evaluation of the previously classified data. At this stage, factors such as the source, reliability, and accuracy of the data are evaluated and comments are made. Interpretation is the process of revealing the meaning and importance of the developments and similar situations based on the available intelligence data in order to reach a definite conclusion. Finally, it is the delivery of the intelligence data passed through these stages to the institutions and organizations that need it, when necessary and with appropriate reporting. And so the intelligence cycle is completed. Most intelligence agencies have given this order different names. There are names such as Intelligence cycle, Intelligence cycle, and Intelligence order. But they are all different nomenclature of the same methodology. Although this cycle often consists of 4 basic steps, it can be divided into different categories and classes as long as more filtering is required. <br>

So, let's get rid of the basics and take a short trip in terms of intelligence. So, what is this intelligence cycle?<br>
