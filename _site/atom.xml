&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hello everyone! I am here with the last article of the basic intelligence series, intelligence types according to their scales. Good reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the previous article, the intelligence series according to their fields, we have elaborated and exemplified the subjects and branches of intelligence according to their fields. Today, I will show you the classification of intelligence types according to their scales and how this classification can create differences on a user basis. So, without further ado, let’s get to the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;intelligence-by-scales&quot;&gt;Intelligence by Scales&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As can be understood from the name of intelligence types according to their scales, it is the name given to the classification of intelligence fields according to their scales or levels. This classification is separated from intelligence completely according to the fields that divide intelligence into two, and it is divided into 3 in some sources and 4 in some sources. This distinction may vary according to each institution and the methods they use, even according to the subjects and services in which they conduct intelligence work. Today, I will cover these 4 basic principles and tell you how important they are in the military sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-intelligence&quot;&gt;Strategic Intelligence&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the meaning of the word strategic intelligence includes, it enables the managers of states or institutions, who have the most authority and authority to make decisions, to produce realistic strategies and plans by strategically identifying threats and opportunities and evaluating them, as well as to gather the necessary information in the implementation process and make greater inferences. intelligence field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the basis of institutions or states, this intelligence field has a great place in the implementation of long-term plans and policies against counter-threats. While this intelligence field on the basis of countries helps to make a more accurate decision process and more accurate decision, on the basis of institutions, this intelligence field helps in the planning of future intelligence operations and ensures stability, and helps the intelligence wheel to function more regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tactical-intelligence&quot;&gt;Tactical Intelligence&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tactical intelligence is an intelligence field that has a very complex structure but is easy to explain. This intelligence field is the intelligence field used to determine the current status, potential, power, and purpose of the friend or foe during operations and wars. The information obtained thanks to this intelligence field is immediately evaluated and directed to the institution or department that needs information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;operational-intelligence&quot;&gt;Operational Intelligence&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operational Intelligence is the intelligence field formed from the whole of tactical intelligence operations working in an integrated manner for a specific purpose or purposes. For states, operational intelligence is used in times of war to obtain information about the status of the front and developments in times of war. In peacetime, this type of intelligence includes military operational exercises and reconnaissance flights. And our last title, Integrated Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;integrated-intelligence&quot;&gt;Integrated Intelligence&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrated intelligence is not a field. We express the order, but in terms of a term; It refers to the efforts of institutions carrying out tactical, operational and strategic intelligence operations to work together and coordinately when needed, to provide continuous information flow and to obtain this information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so we have put the end of our basic intelligence series.
From now on, we will continue with our new series, cyber intelligence. Hope to see you in my new series, building from the ground up and covering all the information an intelligence analyst needs to know.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/alanlarina.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hello again! I am with you with the 4th article of the Basic Intelligence series. In my previous article, Fundamental Principles of Intelligence, with you in my article, confidentiality, speed, accuracy, etc. We covered the principles of intelligence. Today, I have prepared a nice blog post on Intelligence by Field. Without further ado, let’s get to the topic. Have a good read so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;intelligence-by-fields&quot;&gt;Intelligence by Fields&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intelligence according to their fields, as can be understood from the title; refers to the classification of intelligence types according to their fields. Although it doesn’t make sense by definition, the types of intelligence it contains are vitally important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;political-intelligence&quot;&gt;Political Intelligence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political intelligence is the first type of intelligence that comes to mind when the word intelligence is used. In addition, this type of intelligence includes some of the military intelligence and constitutes the most comprehensive issues in intelligence. So let’s examine political intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I have just mentioned, political intelligence includes the most comprehensive subjects of intelligence, but it would be best to examine this type of intelligence in 2 subjects. What are these 2 titles?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foreign Political Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Domestic Political Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It is shaped by two main headings, namely, political intelligence. Well, if we need to examine the concept of foreign political intelligence a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Foreign Political Intelligence;&lt;/b&gt; This intelligence title is an incorruptible structure that has been taken against all other states with which the country has or has not established close relations for its own security, against any recognized or unrecognized state, with or without borders. can be summarized as attitude and attitude. Foreign policy and diplomacy have unbreakable integrity in terms of international relations. It is impossible to break this unity or try to distinguish it from each other. This integrity includes the diplomacy line applied by states against other states today. Therefore, it is completely connected with Foreign Political Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Domestic Political Intelligence;&lt;/b&gt; This intelligence title means that regardless of the management style of the countries, the administrators or administrators, who are the responsible decision-making bodies of the state, are prepared by the authorized intelligence agency or by the administrators against possible threats, taking into account the friendly and enemy factors while managing their countries. It is intelligence made primarily by reasoning. It is not possible to go into detail in this intelligence title. The reason is to give an example because it is deciphered against the management structure, it includes legal responsibilities. That’s why I didn’t want to touch on such an example of domestic political intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s move on to our next title, Military Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;military-intelligence&quot;&gt;Military Intelligence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the first known written sources, the subject that has attracted the most attention of researchers has been the importance given to military intelligence in the inscriptions. Throughout the history of humanity, wars and peace have always witnessed the most important turning points in our civilization history. According to Ümit Özdağ on this subject, 87% of the history of civilization was spent with wars and the remaining 13% with preparations for wars. We are witnessing this today. Whenever there are some political crises between the states, there is no limit to the intelligence operations going around. So a little technical explanation is needed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Military Intelligence;&lt;/strong&gt; One of the most important duties of the states against the societies living in their own lands is to keep the land they hold away from all kinds of internal and external threats, to take measures to ensure its continuity and loyalty, and in this sense to use its armed strength from any angle. is to not hesitate to use it for the permanence of the state and to strive for the permanence of the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military power is the greatest power that states can have against other states in the past and today. But it is necessary to crown it with Intelligence. Gathering information about geographically neighboring states, even in times of peace, laid the groundwork for the most rooted intelligence field in human history. For this reason, Military Intelligence and Political Intelligence are the subjects that have the longest history in this branch of science and should be explained in detail without any misunderstanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-intelligence&quot;&gt;Economic Intelligence&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic Intelligence is the determination and examination of the possibilities and resources of states, terrorist organizations, and organizations in order to determine whether states can achieve their goals against internal or external threats. While conducting economic intelligence studies, for example, studies are carried out under these headings at the stage of gathering information against the target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Target’s Financial Structure and Policy,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Economic Status of the Target,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Monetary Policy of the Target,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Agriculture Sector,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The industry sector,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Trade Sector and Policies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Raw Material Resources,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Size of Import and Export,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stocks and Domestic Production Resources,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;etc.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such titles can be given as examples in this regard. If we think of the titles as a tree, it has hundreds of sub-branches. Economic intelligence studies can vary by institution. The important thing here is to process the data impartially. Otherwise, such a study may fail at some points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, there is one more point that I would like to mention in this regard. The &lt;strong&gt;Economy of the target is in Who or Whom&lt;/strong&gt; hands. The counter threat is directed towards other countries on which it is economically dependent for various reasons, e.g. raw materials, food, industry, technology, etc. Its commitment in areas such as When we look at the history of humanity, the most powerful empires or states developed around the Silk Road route, which was the trade center or source of the time. Therefore, a strong country must have a strong economy. A country with a strong economy will also have advanced intelligence requirements. There can be many comments on the subject, but let’s cut it off here and continue with our other topic, Social Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;social-intelligence&quot;&gt;Social Intelligence&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social Intelligence is an intelligence field that is fully integrated with sociology. So what is sociology? Sociology means society. It examines the social behaviors, movements, religions, views, worldviews, and ideologies of people and therefore societies. Intelligence also benefits from this. Intelligence conducts its studies on societies in times of peace and war, using sociology. It examines the fragile points, sacred and important spiritual values of the people and makes inferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every country has a different social and cultural structure. Social intelligence includes the analysis of the social structure and the data collection and analysis process necessary for a more successful process of intelligence activities against the target society or societies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;geographical-intelligence&quot;&gt;Geographical Intelligence&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geographical Intelligence, the geography of countries has indispensable importance in terms of intelligence. Until the 19th century, knowing the mountains, seas, wetlands, and rivers and learning information such as climate was more important than learning the capacities and powers of the armies in those years, without even having to look at our distant past. On behalf of intelligence agencies and military units, mapping and learning tomographic information of countries and using them in intelligence operations still have a very important place today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, nowadays, with the development of technology, these data are not only accessible to intelligence agencies or military structures. Anyone who wishes can access this information and analyze it. However, individuals or studies without sufficient data always have limited information, but intelligence agencies are obliged to have the most up-to-date and accurate information, and intensive studies are carried out for this. The most effective mapping and imaging studies in this area are spy satellites and observation tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;communications-and-transport-intelligence&quot;&gt;Communications and Transport Intelligence&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communications and Transportation Intelligence; Information about how these regions are managed in times of crisis, radio, television, telephone, highway, airway, sea transportation, trade points, stations, ports, and the characteristics of all these regions. covers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is necessary for countries to collect and report information against each other in times of peace, and to use this information in appropriate conditions and times during times of war. At the point where technology has reached today, individual people can reach this information, which was very important and valuable in the past, with most mapping and navigation systems. However, as I mentioned before, intelligence services have to access the most up-to-date information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;biographical-intelligence&quot;&gt;Biographical Intelligence&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biographical Intelligence is an intelligence field that is applied from the smallest unit affiliated with the state to the most authorized person. This intelligence field includes the private and public information collected about the economic, political, cultural, material, and moral values ​​of the country, as well as the individuals who live in the military and potentially important people as well as individuals with secret connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;technical-intelligence&quot;&gt;Technical Intelligence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technical Intelligence is the acquisition of intelligence using various methods. By definition, its explanation is long and requires detail, because technical intelligence is not applied in a specific way. We need to touch on the various methods and examine their workings. But if we consider it as a technical definition…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Intelligence;&lt;/strong&gt; Collecting information about targets using necessary technology and methods. In order for this intelligence field to function, both technologically technical equipment and personnel to use this equipment are needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technical intelligence is often categorized separately from scientific intelligence, but since they are close and related topics, I will prefer to treat them together. So What Is Scientific Intelligence?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientific Intelligence;&lt;/strong&gt; As can be understood from the name of this intelligence field, it is possible to follow up in the field of science, technology, and weapons owned by rival states, and with the information leak operations to be carried out while this process is running, with the weapons made with minimum resource expenditure based on the research of other states. is to continue the arms, industry, and technology race against other states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;cyber-intelligence&quot;&gt;Cyber Intelligence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering the point where technology and science have come today, Cyber ​​Intelligence, IoTs, Online Services, Data Centers, etc. There have been attacks targeting this data in cyberspace where big data is and is constantly processed. In order to keep up with today’s technologies in order to develop a defense against these attacks, a new intelligence field, cyber intelligence, has emerged. Developed and developing countries invest heavily in this area. In addition, when we look at all other fields, the field of cyber intelligence has been the most invested and rapidly growing intelligence field with the effective and correct use of technology. This development is developing rapidly in all countries where the internet and technology are used and used effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later on cyber intelligence, methods, techniques, cyber world, cyber wars, etc. I will publish my blogs with a learning process like the operation of the basic intelligence series by taking the topics as the title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have come to the end of my blog post for today. Since there are very few resources in this field, I can write my blogs with limited access. However, I will deal with all these topics with examples and details in the future. For now, I hope to see you in my next article, Types of Intelligence by Scale. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Basic Principles of Intelligence</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/basic-principles-of-intelligence"/>
   <updated>2022-07-11T00:00:00+03:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/basic-principles-of-intelligence</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bpoi-main.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This article provides information about the Fundamental Principles of Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first article of the Basic Intelligence series, I touched on basic issues such as Intelligence, the Importance of Intelligence, and the Intelligence Wheel. In this blog post, which is the 3rd article of the series, I will cover the principles of modern intelligence under the title of Basic Principles of Intelligence. I wish you good reading in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intelligence Fundamentals, Confidentiality, Speed, Accuracy etc. includes principles such as These principles are the basic building blocks that work completely in parallel with the intelligence wheel. However, it would not be very accurate to describe them only as building blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;basic-principles-of-intelligence&quot;&gt;Basic Principles of Intelligence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the globalizing and constantly developing world order, we see that the initiatives and formations are increasing day by day, in the intelligence activities of today, getting out of the hands of the states and passing into the hands of multinational companies and companies that carry out regional activities in the private sector. However, in the changing world, the only thing that has changed in the field of intelligence is the loss of the sector from the hands of the states, rather than resorting to private initiatives. Developing and modernizing intelligence techniques and principles. Such principles are the major factor that distinguishes modern intelligence from conventional intelligence. I will talk about the difference between modern intelligence and traditional intelligence later, but for now let’s take a look at the basic principles of intelligence, starting with modern intelligence that gave rise to these principles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; • Principle of  Privacy: &lt;/b&gt;Confidentiality in Intelligence. The principle of confidentiality in intelligence defends the confidentiality of data from institutions, organizations, and employees to the most unauthorized personnel, regardless of what subject and task they are involved in the intelligence process. In response to the potential for information leaks wherever people are, such a policy provides the building blocks for how data is kept secure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; • Principle of Speed: &lt;/b&gt;The speed principle in the intelligence process is a principle that should be applied at every stage of the intelligence wheel. This principle is of great importance in taking action against counterintelligence in the work of Countering Intelligence called IKK. It means that the process should run quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; • Principle of Accuracy: &lt;/b&gt;The principle of accuracy refers to the accuracy of the source of the data in intelligence. There is a principle of accuracy to eliminate all kinds of shady environments, from referring to trusted sources and transmitting and reporting data correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; • Principle of Certainty: &lt;/b&gt;Certainty in intelligence is a principle that has serious implications for public institutions rather than the private sector. To explain this in more detail. The certainty principle states that intelligence must be precise and clear. The principle of certainty advocates a clear stance and behavior in the face of an event. Therefore, intelligence information should be clear and precise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; • Principle of Flexibility: &lt;/b&gt;Another important principle in the intelligence process is the flexibility principle. This principle states that intelligence should constantly evolve. In other words, he argues that the intelligence structure in the developing and globalizing world has to adapt to developments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; • Principle of Impartiality: &lt;/b&gt;The principle of neutrality in intelligence is a principle that can be considered indispensable for a successful intelligence process. This principle states that in the intelligence process, data should be collected objectively by creating an analytical mindset at the stage of intelligence collection. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These principles form the foundations of modern intelligence and paved the way for the intelligence process to abandon the old methods and move from the traditional intelligence process to the modern intelligence process. However, after processing the basic principles of intelligence, we should divide it into two areas and scales. The main reason for this is that modern intelligence has to determine the target in the first place in order to reach the right conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I will end the Basic Intelligence Principles with this article, we will be together again in my next article, Intelligence Types by Fields and Scales.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Intelligence Cycle</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/intelligence-cycle"/>
   <updated>2022-07-04T00:00:00+03:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/intelligence-cycle</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/intelligence_cycle.png&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In this article, the four basic items in the Intelligence Cycle and their in-depth explanations are given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-the-intelligence-cycle&quot;&gt;What is the Intelligence Cycle?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the Intelligence Cycle? As can be seen in the example I added above, the intelligence cycle means the regular and systematic processing of the data obtained through intelligence. This cycle has an endless loop and an operation that constantly renews itself. In addition, intelligence activities are studies that continue uninterrupted. For this reason, many different institutions, basically similar to this methodology, have many different methods of processing intelligence data. However, it is necessary to examine them in 4 main branches:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; • Intelligence Needs Assessment: &lt;/b&gt; Identification of Intelligence Needs, which is the first phase of intelligence, has an important place in the initiation and continuity of the intelligence cycle. In this part, it is aimed to get more results from the institution that will obtain the intelligence, by giving the main information required by the institution or organization that will provide the intelligence to the institution that will obtain the intelligence. Thus, the cycle begins and the intelligence agency bears the responsibility until the last stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; • Intelligence Gathering: &lt;/b&gt; In the second phase of intelligence, the institution or organization requesting the intelligence is completely removed from the intelligence cycle and all the work is left to the intelligence agency. At this stage of the cycle, the “data collection” part, which is the basic building block of the intelligence process, takes charge. At this stage, while the data collection process continues with the institution’s own methods, the data obtained are divided into two open and closed. Since resources such as newspapers, books, magazines, radio, and television are accessible to everyone, they are called Open Sources in this section. In other words, it is a different expression of the Open-Source word that creates OSINT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to open and accessible sources, the data obtained by intelligence agencies by applying different methods and methods during the “data collection” stage are also referred to as closed intelligence data. Well, let’s take a look at what needs to be done after collecting the data.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; • Processing of Intelligence Data: &lt;/b&gt; The third phase of intelligence includes the processing and evaluation of data collected in the previous phase. When collecting intelligence data, we divided it into two parts. This filtering method allowed us to divide the data into two different categories, Open and Closed. The next method for categorizing data is the appraisal and classification part. In this section, the accuracy of the data is first questioned. The data verified by various sources belonging to the institutions are evaluated as to what kind and to what extent it can be used upon incoming demand. To explain in detail. Classification is the first part of this phase. In the evaluation of the data, similar data are brought together thanks to the classification process. Another step is to evaluate the data, in other words, to evaluate it. In the valuation phase, similar data are graded by various methods according to the accuracy and trust of the source. In the last stage, the obtained data is interpreted. As I said at the beginning of my article. Intelligence drives reasoning and achieves results. And so the final phase is passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; • Using Intelligence Data: &lt;/b&gt;In the fourth and final phase of intelligence, there is the use and publication of data that we have evaluated and interpreted in the previous phase. If we take a scenario-based example, after the data obtained as a result of such a cycle is interpreted, based on the necessary analysis and methods, it is transmitted to the institution requesting the intelligence data. Although we seem to have reached the end of such a cycle, we are returning to the first step in the opposite way. That’s why the intelligence cycle is endless. It has a structure that constantly renews itself.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This article contains information about the Definition of Intelligence, the Origin of the Word, the Importance of Intelligence, How to Process Intelligence Data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intelligence refers to the ability to use the mind in the face of events in daily life, to adapt, and to implement it in the light of knowledge and experience.
From the simplest to the most complex events, there is instant intelligence in every aspect of life. Intelligence is first and foremost about the use of reason and intelligence. The simplest and most basic; are reasoning, planning, abstract thinking, comprehension, learning, and learning from experience. All of this is an intelligence process. But intelligence is not just about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-intelligence&quot;&gt;What is Intelligence?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of the meaning of the word intelligence, it was translated into Turkish from Arabic. As the origin of the word, it has gained meaning in Turkish as the plural of the word “Istikhbar”, which expresses the present tense in Arabic. In terms of meaning, it means “news”, “new news”, “new information”. Technically speaking, “Intelligence is a product or information produced as a result of processing news (raw information).” Intelligence is to evaluate raw information and reach a conclusion with activities such as reasoning, planning, and data collection. Thus, the information obtained through intelligence activities is also used in intelligence activities. The information thus obtained is of great importance. How important is intelligence in this situation?
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-intelligence-matters&quot;&gt;Why Intelligence Matters?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we fully understand the meaning of intelligence, it is easier to understand why intelligence is important. Because intelligence means information. The importance of intelligence means to be able to see the future, to have prior knowledge of possible problems that may occur, and reach the real causes and sources of events and information, and intelligence is therefore important. News is raw information. In order to produce intelligence data, raw information must be systematically processed. Important intelligence, in other words, news, if not handled correctly, can lead to wrong results and plot. So how is intelligence data processed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-is-intelligence-data-processed&quot;&gt;How is Intelligence Data Processed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many methods of processing intelligence data. The raw information gathered about an event that has happened or will happen is processed through stages with interpretation and reasoning. Interpretation, that is, classification is the first stage of processing intelligence data. At this stage, similar information is brought together and interpreted among the raw information. Another topic of processing can be said as valuation, that is, valuation. In this process, it is the evaluation of the previously classified data. At this stage, factors such as the source, reliability, and accuracy of the data are evaluated and comments are made. Interpretation is the process of revealing the meaning and importance of the developments and similar situations based on the available intelligence data in order to reach a definite conclusion. Finally, it is the delivery of the intelligence data passed through these stages to the institutions and organizations that need it, when necessary and with appropriate reporting. And so the intelligence cycle is completed. Most intelligence agencies have given this order different names. There are names such as Intelligence cycle, Intelligence cycle, and Intelligence order. But they are all different nomenclature of the same methodology. Although this cycle often consists of 4 basic steps, it can be divided into different categories and classes as long as more filtering is required. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let’s get rid of the basics and take a short trip in terms of intelligence. So, what is this intelligence cycle?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
